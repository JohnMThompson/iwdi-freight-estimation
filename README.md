# Inverse Distance Weighting Interpolation Freight Estimation

I will be recreating a project I did in 2018 creating a method of estimating truck freight costs from a fictional factory to customer locations that factory has never shipped to. 

Originally, I did this using Alteryx since I didn't know Python, or any coding, at the time. It was a great exercise then in figuring out the logic and math, and I'm going to take that knowledge and rebuild it in Python. For the front end I used Tableau and will be looking at a new interactive front end for this version. 

Here's a presentation I gave in 2018 on the method: [Link to Project ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmthomp/overlay/1534972789625/single-media-viewer/)
